Create a Java class called Game. The class must Include:
a. Date
i. number (a random number between 1 and 100)
ii.guessNumber (each guess made by the user)
iii.counter (total number of guesses made so far)
B.Methods
i.generateNumberToBeGuessed()
1.Generates a random number between 1 and 100
ii. makeGuess() receives guessNumber as a parameter
iii. isCorrectGuess() returns a boolean
iv. displayWelcomeMessage()
v. displayPleaseGuessMessage()
vi. dsiplayCorrectGuessMessage()
vii. displayGuessAgainMessage()


Create a Java test class called GuessNumberApp and perform the following:
a. Make an instance of the Game class
b.Call the displayWelcomeMessage) method
c. Create a while loop for a new game that terminates when user types "n”i. Call the generateNumber ToBeGuessed() method
ii. Call the displayPleaseGuessMessage() method
iii.Create a while loop for the new game that terminates when user guessos correctly
1.Prompt user to entor a number between 1 and100
2.Call makeGuess0·assign number guessedto guessNumber() and increment counter by 1
3.Call isCorrectGuess()
a. If true,call displayCorrectMessage() andexit loop
b. If false, call displayGuessAgainMessage()

Add logic to your program so that the following messagesare displayed:
a.If the guess is more than 10 above the number to guess,display Way too high!Guess again”
b.If the guess is 10 or less above the number to guessdisplay"Too high! Guess again."
c.If the guess is more than 10 below the number to guess,display "Way too low! Guess again"
d.If the guess is 10 ot less below the number to guessdisplay "Too lowl Guess again.*
e.If the guess is made in three tries of loss,display "Greatwork! You are a mathematical wizard.".
f.If the guess is made between 4 and 7 tries,display "Nottoo bad! You've got some potential.
g.If the guess is made in more than 7 tries,display"Whattook you so long".
